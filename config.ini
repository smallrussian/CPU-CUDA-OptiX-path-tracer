[CUDA]
; Maximum ray bounce depth for CUDA software ray tracing
; Higher values = more realistic reflections/refractions but slower
; Recommended: 5-15 for most scenes
max_depth = 4
; any more than 4 significantly degrades quality with noise (but i kept it because I dont like harcoded values)

[OptiX]
; OptiX max depth is compiled into the shader (OptixConfig.h)
; Changing this value here has NO effect - you must edit cuda/OptixConfig.h and recompile. The value is only here for informative purposes
; Current compiled value: 4
max_depth = 4

[Rendering]
; Default samples per pixel for rendering
default_samples = 10
